1. **Developing content for seven screens can be time-consuming. Don't leave it to the last minute!**
1. Screens 1 and 7 on the far left and right edges can be difficult to see for people at the ends of tables who have to turn around completely to see the content behind them
1. For this reason, we recommend keeping content on screens 1 and 7 not only static, but also the same from both screens for most presentations. This can include items such as an agenda, names of presenters, maps, affiliations, logos, organizations, sponsors and other reference items
    * We also highly encourage this for technical reasons, especially in the case you are bringing in a remote participant via a third party application such as Google Hangouts, Skype or Zoom. See explanation in [PowerPoint Templates](https://github.com/AK-NSF-EPSCoR/decision-theater-north/wiki/PowerPoint-Templates)
1. To not overwhelm the audience, we recommend displaying new slides one or two at a time, instead of changing all screens at once. This way, people’s attention is drawn to a specific screen
1. Adding to this, as you display slides one at a time from left to right, it is less disruptive to go right to left with the next set of slides instead of traversing the room and starting from the left again
1. For showing/visualizing impact, scale, magnitude or immersion, you can start with the center screen and expand content simultaneously to left and right
1. For synthesis/conclusion, you can start displaying content at the edges and bring it into the middle
1. For collaboration, we recommend using a shared google document or spreadsheet which can be displayed on any screen while accessed and edited from any number of individual laptops 
1. SAGE2 in DTN can be used for screen and content sharing and wireless manipulation from a laptop
1. If your content is web accessible, it is easy to resize browsers and web-apps across any number of screens
1. If you have the time and skill, you can also script custom html files to display content across any number of screens in a web browser
1. If you opt to format the DTN presentation as 7 separate files it’s easier to repurpose the slide content into a single-screen presentation for future use in alternate venues since the dimensions remain the same. When you use a single, wide-slide format for DTN and try to repurpose the content for a single-screen presentation there is more work involved in scaling and redesigning the slides. For some presentations this is a non-issue, since they will only be presented in DTN, but for a group trying to leverage support or disseminate research findings at external meetings this becomes a challenge.
